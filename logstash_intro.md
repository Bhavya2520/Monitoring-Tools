# Introduction to Logstash

## Overview
Logstash is a **data processing pipeline** that ingests, transforms, and forwards data to a target system like Elasticsearch. It plays a central role in the ELK Stack.

## Key Features
- Ingests data from multiple sources (logs, databases, APIs, metrics)
- Data transformation with filters
- Output to multiple destinations (e.g., Elasticsearch, Kafka, files)
- Plugin-based architecture (input, filter, output)

## Use Cases
- Collecting logs from multiple servers
- Parsing and enriching log data
- Forwarding data to Elasticsearch for storage and analysis
