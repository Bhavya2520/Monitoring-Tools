# ELK Stack: How Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana Work Together

## Integration Overview
The ELK Stack combines three tools to provide a complete **log management and analysis** solution.

- **Logstash**: Collects, parses, and transforms log data.
- **Elasticsearch**: Stores and indexes the log data.
- **Kibana**: Visualizes the data and provides dashboards.

## Workflow
1. Applications and servers generate logs.
2. Logstash collects and processes the logs.
3. Transformed logs are sent to Elasticsearch for storage and indexing.
4. Kibana queries Elasticsearch and presents data visually.
